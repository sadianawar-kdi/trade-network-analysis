# International Trade Network Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes international export relationships using Python-based network analysis. Global trade flows are modeled as a directed weighted network to study country-level connectivity and influence.
This project was independently developed as part of advanced coursework and research in data analytics and network analysis.
## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib

## Methodology
- Cleaned and transformed export-import trade data
- Constructed a directed weighted graph where nodes represent countries and edges represent export values
- Performed network analysis including density, degree, weighted degree, centrality, and shortest path analysis

## Key Insights
- Identified highly central countries in global trade networks
- Analyzed trade concentration using weighted degree measures
- Explored ego networks and connectivity patterns

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming
- Data preprocessing
- Graph-based data modeling
- Network analysis
- Data visualization
